<p>I am Pelle Braendgaard. Pronounce it like Pel√© the footballer (no relation). I live in wonderful <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pelle/sets/72157617527841351/">Miami Beach</a>. I like clojure, ruby, building stuff, travel, food, wine, rum and trying to help build a new financial system from the grass roots up.</p>

<h4>Consulting</h4>
<p>I am available to help you out with your project for shorter projects involving Clojure, Datomic, Ruby, OAuth, payments and/or Identity. Please contact me at <a href="mailto:pelle@stakeventures.com">pelle@stakeventures.com</a>.</p>

<p>I normally work remote but may be available for a couple of days onsite in the US, Europe and Latin America if you are prepared to pay expenses. My base rate is $155/h with discounts available for ongoing gigs and for clojure as I'm relatively new in the field.</p>
